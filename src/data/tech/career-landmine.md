# What are some common career landmines people step on?

**Workaholism**. A compulsion to work excessively hard and long hours.

Mr. Workaholic works long hours. He’s the star of the month.

He flaunts his certifications in his LinkedIn, gets 22,343 likes and 300 new connections.

He works on weekends, gets a 22% raise, not realizing that 22% of nothing is still nothing.

He’s always online, sends mails at odd hours, comments on your PR incessantly.

The code becomes his baby. He over protects it, alienates people who criticize it.

He’s there when you reach work. He’s there when you leave.

All is good until management starts expecting it every month. He has a reputation to maintain, agrees.

He succumbs to pressure, fails in his love life. His health declines.

He asks for a raise, quits. Management doesn’t retain him.

He alienates people. Onset of depression.

Management gives him a great send off with a coffee mug as gift.

Management hires another workaholic in his place. They start setting you unrealistic goals based on Mr. Workaholic.

You begin thinking of a change.

All as a result of a chain reaction set off when one person decided he will work his rear off!

Workaholism affects you and others around you. Great companies don't look for people who work all the time, they look for people who know the boundaries and the problems of crossing it.

So, leave work at work. Do not judge someone when he leaves at 5. Judge yourself for not having a work-life balance.

When I see workaholics now, I secretly laugh at the slippery slope they are in.
