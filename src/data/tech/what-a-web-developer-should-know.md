# What a Web developer should know

## Background

I believe that true Web Developers are inherently Fullstack. They tend to have one particular focus area and some knowledge in other areas. Fullstack Development is a relatively new thing. It came into existence only in the past decade or so. The term is being thrown around like ragdolls these days. It came into existence with the coming of age of Javascript as a programming language and it was adopted in backend and IOT devices with the emergence of NodeJS which gave developers access to the filesystem which Javascript didnt. These days, Fullstack development seems to have many branches and the most popular languages web or otherwise have come under the umbrella of 'Fullstack Development'. I hear terms like 'Java Fullstack', 'Node Fullstack' which make me cringe. In this post, I will be focusing on Web Development with a focus on frontend (as that's my speciality). In my experience, working over 10 years in the field, I have realized that the following things are important and are reasonable expectations from an Engineer.

## Problem Solving

First and foremost is problem solving. You need to have a decent knowledge in computer science and programming. You need to have a reasonable understanding of DataStructures and Algorithms. Irrespective of you being frontend or backend focused, this is a must for any Software Engineer. And I agree. Given a problem, you need to be able to come up with a consice solution using code in a time and space efficient way. Because in the web, a few seconds make a huge difference.

## Domain knowledge

The Web is the domain I work on. I have been living in it for most of my life one way or the other. So this came easy for me. I built expertise by building a lof of stuff, working on a lot of projects, creating something end to end and deploying to production. It comes with a passion for the field.

## Frontend

**Note**: I will lay emphasis on Frontend as it has been my core area. If backend is your core area, lay more focus on that.

In frontend, your work will revolve to the most extent around Javascript. So, its imperative that you master it. Then comes the frameworks. These include React, Angular and Vue. Some companies expect some native knowledge like React Native/Flutter. You could use some online learning platform to learn these. I relied on documentations, POCs, and personal projects for this **in addition to** working in the field. I see a lot of developers these days attending a 3 month training in the web and struggling to apply that knowledge. One common mistake developers do is to jump into the frameworks without having a strong knowledge of the basics of Javascript. This is because there are 2 kinds of developers. Those who are focussed on getting a quick job and those who are in the field for the long haul. Shortcuts get you only as far as the average jobs out there and the competition for those jobs is great.

## Backend

You need to be reasonably good in any one of the backend languages. Python seems to be in hot demand these days. For me it was NodeJS. It could be Java/Python/Go/C# or whatever. But whichever langugage it may be for you, you need to have a strong grasp of the concepts. If you were to create your own website, you would need to write your own backend. When you work in a team, you would need to communicate with backend developers and come to understandings on certain issues. So, a little bit of knowledge here helps.

## Databases

You need to be able to design, configure and use databases. You need to know the pros and cons of certain types of databases and you need to be able to tell which one to use for which usecases. Although my role here has been limited over the years as I was more focussed on the frontend stuff. But, working on some personal projects exposed me to databases.

## DevOps/Networking

It is essential that you know things like Git, Docker, Kubernetes, Cloud solutions etc. You need to be able to wite the code and know how to take it to production and monitor it after its release.

## Testing

You need to be able to follow a TDD/BDD approach in writing software. You need to be able to tell when and where unit tests/e2e tests are required. Some companies go for only BDD. It gives them enough confidence that the application works. Some companies go for a combination of TDD and BDD. But, from what I see, BDD seems to be the way forward.

## System Design

You need to be able to come up with the design for a problem statement. Some examples include designing Uber, Instagram etc. You need to be able to discuss the approach you take for your design.

## Software Engineering

Lastly, you need to be able to write clean, efficient, readable, scalable and maintainable code. You also need to be able to do code review and pair programming. And most importantly, you need to be able to work in a team with people from various backrounds and knowledge levels. You may be the best at what you do, but you still may not be the perfect fit for the team if your soft skills dont match the technical skills. Toxic atmospheres affect companies and its people adversely.

## Conclusion

You cannot build all of the above expertise with just training alone. This needs years of perfection to accomplish. If you are a beginner, it helps to know what is out there. If you are mid-level, its time for you to go deeper into these areas. And if you are senior, its time to mentor others and show them the way.
