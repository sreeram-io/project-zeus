## 2005-11 Freelancer days

The story unfolds in 2005 when my friends at school created an online forum for my class which created a buzz. It was used for all the class discussions/gossips. They also monetized it using Google Adsense. Although being new to computers, I was excited about what they did and wanted to do it myself. Thats when I found Blogger. I didnt have to know anything technical to use Blogger. I also enrolled in Adsense but never really got paid because my blog wasn't very popular. Thats how I took the baby steps into the ocean of Web Development. It wasnt until 2007/8 when I wanted to build a game for my college festival. So I built the Z Axis Challenge. I started with HTML, creating webpages with Dreamweaver and softwares like that, encrypting them using a software with the answer as the password, and deployed it somewhere. I dont remember what happened after that but it was an epic failure. So I set out to learn and do it properly. I learnt some basic HTML, CSS, and PHP and ended up creating a basic version of the game. And voila, it was well received. Around 500 people registered and played the game of 40 levels and somebody won. Then, I started to conduct this game independently on my own. They were all reasonably good successes. I used to attend Web Development contests throughout my final 2 years of college which I'd mostly win. I remember the days when I would be travelling in a bus with a note in my hand with the all the syntaxes like links, script tags etc which I would memorize. My friends took turns to be my partner and we split the prize money. In 2011, I was asked to create the website for RAICS - an International IEEE conference on the Recent Advancements in Intelligent Computing Systems.

## 2011 - First real job

In June 2011, I joined **Mistallianz** at Trivandrum, a startup where I worked as a PHP Developer for 6 months while also studying in college. Towards the end of 2011, I started and failed in creating my own start up called* vyakthitva.com* (vyakthitva stands for individuality in Sanskrit). An online platform where people can create their portfolio/resume/website and recruiters can search and find them. I ended it abrupty because I wasnt fully convinced with it. Also, I had to move to Cochin for a new job.

## 2012 - Career in Wipro Kochi, Chennai & Bangalore

So in 2012, I joined **Wipro Technologies** as a Software Engineer. Throughout school and college, I hated computer science to the core. I think I didnt understand its beauty coupled with Mathematics. But through some outworldly intervention, I did well in the 3 month rigorous training where I found Unix and C very interesting. I finished in the top 5 in a class of 23 for a guy who absolutely didnt know or like Computer Science or programming until just 3 months prior to that. Although I was a C developer initially, I found my own opportunity in Web Development in a different location for a different client. So I moved to Chennai to work for Apple. I also made frequent official visits to Bangalore.

## 2016 - Moving to London

In 2016, I was deputed by Wipro to London to work for **Lloyds Banking Group**. The work there was challenging. Suddenly, from a Junior developer in offshore, I was put into a role where had to take major decisions for the Statements team as a Frontend Lead, a page used by millions in the UK every single day. That was daunting. So many ups and downs but it was the best time of my life. I made some great friends and connections which I will cherish for the rest of my life. Amazing people! In 2017, I travelled all around Europe solo just to come out of my comfort zone.

## 2019 - Moving to Berlin

I moved to Berlin in 2019 for yet another adventure to work for **Delivery Hero** to take up a Tech lead position. It was a high octane environment. I learnt so much so quickly. I worked there for 2 years. It was a great company and I worked with some of the best engineers in the world. Made some great friends from various parts of the world who I wouldn't have met otherwise. Thats one of the perks of working in a Unicorn startup I guess.

## 2021 - Moving back to London

The pandemic had a rather negative impact on me trying to set up a new life in a new country. Anyway, it is about to get over and I decided that it was time to make another move. I looked at a potential few countries in Europe and Asia and, after much deliberation, I decided to go back to London. I will be working for **Bumble** as a Senior Frontend Engineer.
