# Using the web to declutter life

#### *17 Oct 2021, London*

&nbsp;

I am a Web Developer. I spend a big chunk of my life creating things in the virtual world. Over the past decade, my life changed drastically and quick. I realized that my life had become very fast paced and haphazard. Changing 3 countries in a matter of 5 years made it worse. There was always something to do which I kept forgetting. There were too many repetitive and mundane tasks which took up a lot of my time, like changing houses, filing taxes, making payments, changing passwords, taking pictures of documents for some visa application etc. I started to feel I was missing out on the important things in life, I started to forget things. Something or ther other kept lingering in the back of my mind and I didnt know what. It was just utter chaos. And it was hard to explain others as well. It was consuming so much of my time in a day. And thats when I decided to declutter my life. With a few simple tricks, I have been able to save on precious time and money. In this post, I will explain how.

Broadly speaking, I did 2 things:

(1) Divide my life into categories

(2) Use apps and websites to work for me

Over the past years, I have realized that my life revolves mainly around 14 categories. It was about 25 to begin with but I trimmed it to the following: **Accommodation, Business, Career, Entertainment, Family, Finance, Health, Learn, Read, Shopping, Social, Tax, Travel & Work**

These days, there are apps for everything. And high speed internet has become common. And I realized that Google has everything I needed to achieve this goal of decluttering.

### How I use Google Chrome

The browser is my friend. Its my workplace as a web developer. I tend to bookmark all important websites into the 14 categories. The mantra I follow is I should be able to go into a website by cliking one of the bookmarks or opening an app in phone and not having to type anything in the address bar.

I let Google Chrome manage my passwords. All of them are generated by the inbuilt password generator and stored in my account. But what it also means is if someone were to get access to my Google account, they pretty much can do anything they want. But Google detects suspicious logins and I keep an eye on them.

### How I use Google Drive

All of my documents are stored in Google Drive. Not in my computer. And they are divided into these categories. Google gives you enough storage for a life time. If not, you can subscribe to Google One to increase the limit. You can create a Google family and share the space with upto 6 others.

The best thing about Cloud storage is it can be accessed from anywhere. Lets take a boarding pass as an example. All you need to do is put it in your Drive and you will never lose it. You can access it from any of your other devices and you can get rid of all the printing madness.

You can also install the Google Drive software in your computer or phone and have all the files backed up and synced. This way, you can switch to any new device and you only need to install Google Drive without having to worry about copying your files into a pendrive or whatever.

### How I use Google Mail

How many unread mails have you got? 1000? 10000? so much that you dont even bother to check mails? I always check my mails and I read all of them. I have created filters which divide emails into these categories as they come. This helps me in prioritizing which emails to read and which ones to pass. That way, I know where to find my job emails and where to find my monthly statements and receipts.

### How I use Google Photos

I use my phone to take pictures/videos. All of my photos are backed up into Google Photos. Until June 2021, Google let you backup high quality photos into Google Photos without it consuming your 15GB quota. Unfortunately, they have stopped it now and it counts against your total storage quota. But, it still doesnt eat away all your space. By doing this, I am sure of not losing any photos I take. Google smartly suggests you to organize these pictures into albums.

### How I use Google Keep

I keep a note of important stuff in my Google Keep. Right from my addresses in 3 different countries to account numbers to harmonica notes, they are all stored in Google Keep. All of my reminders go in there too. From birthday reminders to anniversaries to payments, Google Keep reminds me of it on the day.

### How I use Google timeline

I like to keep track of everywhere I have been to. I have been doing this over the past 10 years. My phone keeps sending regular location updates to my Google Account and it builds up this amazing plot of all the places I have been to over the years like shown here. It also shares memories from the past of places you have been to before. Isnt that amazing or what! You can do this by turning your location history on. Some people dont like doing this because it intrudes into their privacy. It can also drain your battery. But for some reason, I really like this idea. It also tracks the number of steps I walked, cycled or rode in a car. Its also also shared with my family who are able to find where I am in the world pin pointing to the exact location at any given moment. Might come handy if I go missing. Lol. So far, Google tells me I have visited 14 countries, 68 cities and 753 places.

### Conclusion

To conclude, by doing this, I have been able to focus on my life, my health, my family and my career. These are big wins you can get for free. All you need to do is spend some time building this structure.

And strictly following this time and space management is, infact, believe it or not, the secret of my success.
